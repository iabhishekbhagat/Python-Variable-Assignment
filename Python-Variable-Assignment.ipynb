    "Variable Names: Use descriptive and meaningful names that reflect the purpose of the variable. Variable names should be in lowercase, and multiple words can be separated using underscores. For example: age, first_name, student_count.\n",

    "Avoid Reserved Words: Do not use Python's reserved keywords as variable names. For example, you cannot use if, for, or print as variable names.\n",
    "\n",
    "Snake Case: Preferred naming convention is to use snake_case, where words are separated by underscores. This convention is widely used in Python. For example: user_name, total_amount.\n",
    "\n",
    "Meaningful Abbreviations: Avoid excessive use of abbreviations, unless they are widely known and understood within the context of your code. It is better to have longer but more descriptive names. For example, use customer_name instead of cust_nm.\n",

    "Constants: If a variable represents a constant value, such as a configuration or a mathematical constant, use uppercase letters and underscores to separate words. For example: PI, MAX_RETRIES.\n",

    "Avoid Single-letter Variable Names: Except in cases like loop counters (i, j, k), avoid using single-letter variable names. It makes the code more readable when variable names are descriptive.\n",
    "Avoid Reserved Names: Avoid using leading or trailing double underscores (__) in variable names, as they have special meanings in Python.\n",

    "Initialize Variables: It is a good practice to initialize variables when they are declared, even if you plan to assign a value to them later. This helps in avoiding potential errors due to uninitialized variables.\n",
    "Variable Scope: Ensure that variables are declared in the appropriate scope. Variables defined inside a function or a block are local to that scope, while variables defined outside any function or block have global scope.\n",
    "Use Type Hints: When declaring variables, you can use type hints to indicate the expected data type. Although not mandatory, type hints improve code clarity and can help catch type-related errors. For example: age: int, name: str.\n",
    "\n",
